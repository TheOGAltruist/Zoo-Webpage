            <h3>Bears</h3>
            <p>
                Bears are some of the largest land predators. They are all omnivorous creatures but their
                diet varies depending on the type of bear and their geographical location. We have two different types
                of bears with us in the Zoo:

                        Ollie - He is an American Black Bear. Very shy but will attack if approached without
                        caution.

            <h3>Giraffes</h3>
            <p>
                Giraffes are the tallest land animals. They are herbivorous creatures and very friendly. However, it is
                always advisable to remain cautious around them because their sheer size could endanger you. We have two
                Giraffes here at the Zoo. Frankie is 6 months old and Coconut, his mother, is 7 years old:

            <h3>Lions</h3>
            <p>
                Lions are majestic and are rightly called the King of the Jungle due to their intimidating size. They
                are primarily carnivorous. Here are some of the most important instructions:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>DO NOT</strong> step into their enclosure alone.</li>
                <li>Always remember to carry a stick with you for protection. Although it will not deter them from
                    harming you, but it will discourage them.</li>
                <li>Never hand feed them when inside the enclosure.</li>
                <li>Never turn your backs to them. Their hunting instincts will kick in.</li>
                <li>ALways make sure they are inside the "caves" and secured before starting any type of cleaning or
                    maintenance activities inside the enclosure.</li>
            </ol>
            <strong>NOTE:</strong> Additional information and training on handling them will be provided during
            onboarding. Be sure to ask your trainer for a hard copy of the instructions. <br><br>
            We have two of them here at the Zoo:

            <h3>Monkeys</h3>
            <p>
                Monkeys are primates, just like humans. There are many different types of Monkeys and the ones here at
                the Zoo are Rhesus Monkeys. They are friendly and do not mind humans stepping inside their cage. They
                tend to get loud at times. As with any wild animal, always excercise caution when dealing with them. We
                have a family of 3 here at the Zoo. The youngest is Cookie who is about 4 months old. The father Earl
                and his mother, Banana Pudding:

            <h3>Alligators</h3>
            <p>
                Gators are apex predators. At the Zoo, we have 3 fully grown American Alligator adults that are large in
                size. Although
                they generally do not mind humans in their enclosures, they will attack in self-defence if they feel
                threatened. Be extremely cautious before entering their enclosures and always keep them within sight.
                They are ambush predators and will take every oppotunity available, to hunt.
